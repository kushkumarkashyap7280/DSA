# Day 103: Binary Tree Path Sum Problems

## Overview

Day 103 focuses on binary tree path sum problems covering various scenarios from simple root-to-leaf path sums to complex path sum III problems. The day includes problems involving path tracking, sum calculation, and advanced tree traversal techniques. Each problem demonstrates different approaches including DFS, recursion, and optimized solutions for complex tree scenarios.

## Problems Covered

### 1. Path Sum (Leetcode 112)

**File:** [Leetcode_112.cpp](./Leetcode_112.cpp)

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode 112 - Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

**Problem:** Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return true if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals targetSum.

**Key Points:**

- Path must start from root and end at a leaf node
- Return true if any such path exists, false otherwise
- A leaf is a node with no children

**Example:**

```
Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1], targetSum = 22
Output: true
Explanation: The root-to-leaf path with the target sum is shown.

Input: root = [1,2,3], targetSum = 5
Output: false
Explanation: There are two root-to-leaf paths in the tree:
(1 --> 2): The sum is 3.
(1 --> 3): The sum is 4.
There is no root-to-leaf path with sum = 5.
```

**Approach Implemented:**

```cpp
class Solution {
  bool isPossible(TreeNode* root, int &targetSum, int sum, bool &found) {
     if(!root) return false;
     if(found) return true;
     if(!root->left && !root->right){
             if((sum + root->val) == targetSum){
                 found = true;
                 return found;
             }
             return found;
     }
     bool left = isPossible(root->left, targetSum, sum + root->val, found);
     bool right = isPossible(root->right, targetSum, sum + root->val, found);

     return left || right;
 }
public:
 bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
     if(!root) return false;
     bool found = false;
    found = isPossible(root, targetSum, 0, found);
   return found;
 }
};
```

**Key Insight:** Track running sum and check at leaf nodes for target sum match.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - visit each node once
**Space Complexity:** O(h) - recursion stack depth

### 2. Path Sum III (Leetcode 437)

**File:** [Leetcode_437.cpp](./Leetcode_437.cpp)

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode 437 - Path Sum III](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/)

**Problem:** Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return the number of paths where the sum of the values along the path equals targetSum. The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards.

**Key Points:**

- Paths can start and end anywhere in the tree
- Must go downwards (parent to child)
- Count all such paths

**Example:**

```
Input: root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], targetSum = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: The paths that sum to 8 are shown.

Input: root = [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1], targetSum = 22
Output: 3
```

**Approach Implemented:**

```cpp
class Solution {
  void solve(TreeNode* root, int &targetSum, int &count, vector<int> &path) {
      if(!root) return;
      path.push_back(root->val);
      solve(root->left, targetSum, count, path);
      solve(root->right, targetSum, count, path);

     long long sum = 0;
      for(int i = path.size()-1; i >= 0; i--) {
          sum += path[i];
          if(sum == targetSum) count++;
      }
       path.pop_back();
  }
public:
  int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
      if(!root) return 0;
      vector<int> path;
      int count = 0;
      solve(root, targetSum, count, path);
      return count;
  }
};
```

**Key Insight:** Check all possible subpaths ending at each node.

**Time Complexity:** O(nÂ²) - for each node, check all paths ending at it
**Space Complexity:** O(h) - recursion stack depth

### 3. Maximum Level Sum (Leetcode 1161)

**File:** [Leetcode_1161.cpp](./Leetcode_1161.cpp)

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode 1161 - Maximum Level Sum of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-level-sum-of-binary-tree/)

**Problem:** Given the root of a binary tree, the level of its root is 1, the level of its children is 2, and so on. Return the smallest level x such that the sum of all the values of nodes at level x is maximal.

**Key Points:**

- Find the level with maximum sum
- If multiple levels have same sum, return the smallest level
- Level numbering starts from 1

**Example:**

```
Input: root = [1,7,0,7,-8,null,null]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Level 1 sum = 1.
Level 2 sum = 7 + 0 = 7.
Level 3 sum = 7 + -8 = -1.
So we return the level with the maximum sum which is level 2.
```

**Approach Implemented:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxLevelSum(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        int maxSum = INT_MIN;
        int maxLevel = 1;
        int level = 1;

        queue<TreeNode*> q;
        q.push(root);

        while (!q.empty()) {
            int s = q.size();
            int levelSum = 0;

            while (s--) {
                TreeNode* temp = q.front();
                q.pop();
                levelSum += temp->val;

                if (temp->left) q.push(temp->left);
                if (temp->right) q.push(temp->right);
            }

            if (levelSum > maxSum) {
                maxSum = levelSum;
                maxLevel = level;
            }
            level++;
        }
        return maxLevel;
    }
};
```

**Key Insight:** Use BFS to track level sums and find the level with maximum sum.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - visit each node once
**Space Complexity:** O(w) - where w is maximum width of tree

### 4. Sum of Nodes on the Longest Path

**File:** [Sum_of_nodes_on_the_longest_path.cpp](./Sum_of_nodes_on_the_longest_path.cpp)

**Problem Link:** [GeeksForGeeks - Sum of nodes on the longest path from root to leaf node](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sum-of-nodes-on-the-longest-path-from-root-to-leaf-node/1)

**Problem:** Given a binary tree of size N. Your task is to complete the function sumOfLongRootToLeafPath(), that takes the root node of the binary tree as parameter and returns the sum of all nodes on the longest path from root to leaf node.

**Key Points:**

- Find the longest path from root to leaf
- If multiple paths have same length, return the one with maximum sum
- Return the sum of nodes on that path

**Example:**

```
Input:
        4
       / \
      2   5
     / \ / \
    7  1 2  3
      /
     6
Output: 13
Explanation:
        4
       / \
      2   5
     / \ / \
    7  1 2  3
      /
     6
The highlighted path (4->2->1->6) gives the maximum sum as (4 + 2 + 1 + 6) = 13
```

**Approach Implemented:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void solve(Node* root, int sum, int len, int &maxLen, int &maxSum) {
        if (!root) return;

        sum += root->data;
        len++;

        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            if (len > maxLen) {
                maxLen = len;
                maxSum = sum;
            } else if (len == maxLen) {
                maxSum = max(maxSum, sum);
            }
            return;
        }

        solve(root->left, sum, len, maxLen, maxSum);
        solve(root->right, sum, len, maxLen, maxSum);
    }

    int sumOfLongRootToLeafPath(Node* root) {
        int maxLen = 0;
        int maxSum = 0;
        solve(root, 0, 0, maxLen, maxSum);
        return maxSum;
    }
};
```

**Key Insight:** Track both length and sum of paths, update when longer path found or same length with higher sum.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - visit each node once
**Space Complexity:** O(h) - recursion stack depth

### 5. Lowest Common Ancestor (Leetcode 236)

**File:** [Leetcode_236.cpp](./Leetcode_236.cpp)

**Problem Link:** [LeetCode 236 - Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/)

**Problem:** Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree. The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants.

**Key Points:**

- LCA is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants
- A node can be a descendant of itself
- Both p and q exist in the tree

**Example:**

```
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself.
```

**Approach Implemented:**

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode* root, TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (!root) return nullptr;
        if (root->val == p->val || root->val == q->val) {
            return root;
        }

        TreeNode* left = lowestCommonAncestor(root->left, p, q);
        TreeNode* right = lowestCommonAncestor(root->right, p, q);

        if (left && right) {
            return root;
        }
        if (left && !right) return left;
        if (right && !left) return right;

        return nullptr;
    }
};
```

**Key Insight:** If both nodes are found in different subtrees, current node is LCA.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) - visit each node once
**Space Complexity:** O(h) - recursion stack depth
